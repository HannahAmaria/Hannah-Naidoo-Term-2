# About the Project
## Project Description
Welcome to MediCare! This is a medical receptionists database to create, read, update and delete patients and doctors.

# Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites
For development, the installation of XAMPP is required. 

## Installation

1.  GitHub Desktop </br>
    Enter `https://github.com/HannahAmaria/Hannah-Naidoo-Term-2` into the URL field and press the `Clone` button.

2.  Clone Repository </br>
    Run the following in the command line to clone the project:
    
        gh repo clone HannahAmaria/Hannah-Naidoo-Term-2
 
4.  Install Dependencies </br>
    Run the following in the command line to install all the required dependencies:

        npm install

# Concept Process

I went with a simple and minimalistic UI design.
## Ideation

I wanted to create a simple website where receptionists can create, read, update and delete patients and doctors.

# Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done for the app.

## Implementation Process

- I used `npx create-react app` to create this React project. I implemented component-based development instead of classes. By doing this, I will be able to easily inject and eject components and sub-components into my project, making it refactorable and reusable instead of writing up classes I have to do every time making it tedious and redundant

- I obeyed the `saas` styling of my project which is slightly different from `scss` as the manner in which indentation has been applied is important and semi-colons are not allowed 

- `Axios` was implemented so that I can make HTTP requests to the BallDontLie API so that I can dynamically display these datasets on a magic chart called charts.js version 5

### Highlights

- The login, sign up and cart functionality was quite easy to implement
- ChatGPT made the workload easier

### Challenges

- XAMPP crashing
- Receptionist admin rights

## Future Implementation

- I would have loved to spend more time working on the front end design

# Final Outcome
